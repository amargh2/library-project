library
This is a library app assigned as a learning project from The Odin Project. It tests ability to create event listeners, forms, DOM manipulation, and using more advanced selectors, including data selectors. 

The user enters author, title, pages, and answers whether they have read the book, and a corresponding book 'card' is populated into a grid on the screen, with working buttons to change the read/unread status of the book, along with a button to delete the card from the library.
